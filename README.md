# ML-Based-Credit-card-Fraud-Detection
This repository contains the code and resources for building a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. With the rise in online transactions, ensuring the security of credit card payments is more crucial than ever. This project aims to leverage machine learning techniques to identify fraudulent activities and protect users from financial losses.
# Key Features
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding the distribution and patterns in the data.
Model Building: Implementing various machine learning algorithms to train and test the fraud detection model.
Model Evaluation: Assessing the performance of the model using appropriate metrics.
Deployment: Integrating the model into a real-time system for fraud detection.
# Dataset
We utilize a publicly available dataset containing credit card transactions, which includes both legitimate and fraudulent transactions. The dataset allows us to train and evaluate our model effectively.
